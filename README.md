# Apis-mellifera-virus-1
This project analyzes Apis mellifera virus 1, a small ssDNA virus infecting honey bees. Using genome analysis, ORF prediction, hydrophobicity profiling, BLAST, and phylogenetics, it identifies key proteins, genome size consistency, and closest relatives, showing no host switching or antigenic shift.
